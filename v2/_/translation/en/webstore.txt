Country Flags & IP Whois add-on is an extension that displays a flag toolbar button indicating the current webserver's physical location using an off-line database. Knowing the server location adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information about Geolocation or Whois info can be obtained via the click on the toolbar icon.
